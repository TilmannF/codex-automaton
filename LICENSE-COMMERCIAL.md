# Commercial Licensing Notes

This file is a plain-language companion to `LICENSE` (BUSL-1.1).  
If there is any conflict, `LICENSE` is authoritative.

## Intent

- This framework is intended to stay easy to use for individuals, startups, and
  many small/medium companies.
- The BUSL thresholds are a safety measure against large-scale, uncompensated
  commercial extraction.
- The goal is not to make life harder for smaller or medium-sized companies.
- For larger organizations, the goal is practical and fair cooperation through
  competitive commercial terms.

## Commercial License Requirement

If your organization exceeds any of the BUSL Additional Use Grant thresholds in
`LICENSE`, you must obtain a commercial license for Production Use.
